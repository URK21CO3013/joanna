                <p>I know we argue and fight all the time nowadays but i want you to know that even if we don't understand each other a lot. I know not being good and I know that I have changed nowadays, I know I'm not same as before I am because of some misunderstanding and of my overthinking. The one thing that bothering me is you're not giving enough attention and time compared to last year that makes me to overthink and overthinking made me angry and irritated. And I don't know how to stop your overthinking also i don't know how to comfort you, I know you only expect little little things from me. Sorry for everything.. and i want you to know that you're the reason why I smile everyday, you're the reason why my heart is full because of your love I became a better person. Whatever happens my love for you will never ever fade away, sorry for being a hard headed partner, Sorry if I'm always giving you a hard time. But one thing I'm sure of is that I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH with all my heart and no one can replace you.......

              Happy first anniversary! It feels like just yesterday we were sitting across from each other at that coffee shop, talking for hours about everything and nothing. I knew from the moment I saw you that you were someone special.
              Over the past year, we've shared so many amazing memories together. We've laughed together, cried together, and supported each other through thick and thin. You've made me a better person, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life.
              Ilove the way you make me laugh. I love the way you always know how to make me feel better when I'm down. I love the way you look at me, like
              I'm the only person in the world.
              I can't imagine my life without you. You're my best friend, my lover, and my soulmate. I love you more than words can say.
              Here's to many more years of love, laughter, and happiness together.
              Love always,<br>
              Mervin</p>

            <p>Dear Sharon,<br>
              Happy anniversary, my love! Today marks a whole year since we embarked on this beautiful journey of love, and I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for having you by my side. This past year has been filled with countless cherished memories, laughter, and an abundance of love that continues to grow with each passing day.
              Reflecting on our time together, I am amazed at how quickly the days have flown by, yet how deeply our connection has blossomed. From the moment our paths crossed, I knew there was something special between us, something that would defy the passage of time. And here we are, one year stronger, still radiating with the same passion and affection that brought us together.
              Through both joyful and challenging times, we have stood together as a team, supporting and uplifting one another. Your unwavering presence and unconditional love have been a constant source of strength and comfort in my life. Your understanding, empathy, and willingness to listen have touched my heart in ways I never thought possible.
              Together, we have created a tapestry of shared experiences, from romantic getaways to cozy nights in, from heartfelt conversations to playful moments that made us laugh until our bellies ached. I cherish every single moment spent with you, and I am grateful for the love and happiness you bring into my life.
              You have taught me the true meaning of love and selflessness. You have shown me that together, we can conquer any obstacle that comes our way. Your patience, kindness, and genuine care for others inspire me to be a better person each day. With you, I feel safe to be my authentic self, knowing that you accept me completely, flaws and all.
              As we celebrate this milestone, I want you to know that my love for you knows no bounds. It grows stronger with each passing day, and I am excited to see what the future holds for us. I look forward to many more years of shared adventures, laughter, and building a life together.
              Thank you for choosing me to be your partner, confidant, and lover. You have brought immense joy into my life, and I am forever grateful for your presence. Happy anniversary, my love!
              <br>Yours eternally,<br>

              I am sorry for that what I did with you. I was wrong, you were right. I did not realize your importance in my life, but now I can realize my fault. I cannot express my emotion for you. Please forgive me. Now I miss you badly. I was very happy with you. Hope you forgive me and I just want to say I am sorry. It was a big mistake. I want you to know that I love you and that no matter the distance and what I'm doing, I'm always thinking of you. Every free moment I have, no matter how small, I want to spend it with you.</p>

              We started our journey together, With love and happiness.
              Our first kiss was in August, In Bethesda, in the afternoon.
              We've had our ups and downs, But we always come out stronger.
              You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, And I love you more than words can say. l'II be with you forever, And I'II never leave you.
              We're celebrating our first anniversary today, And I can't wait to see what the future holds.
